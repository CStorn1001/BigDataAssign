# BigDataAssign

My first Big data Assignment within university where I was given Twitter Tweets data to analyse a given set of questions. The questions and explanations can be found within the documentation pdf. Within this project I used:
* Studio3T (an IDE of MongoDB) for data curation
* PyMongo - a library in python used to interact with MongoDB data via python
* MrJob - a library used to conduct Map-Reduce on the data
My final grade was 99%.
